First, on the FPGA side which had a decoder for the keyboard where the user inputs were subsequently processed to carry out the corresponding operation on an ALU also designed in the FPGA. The second part of this project consisted of communicating the FPGA with the HPS (Hard Processor System) and in this way show the keyboard inputs as well as the results of the operations on an LCD screen which was controlled from the HPS. |
