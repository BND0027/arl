It supports access to secure and managed data through federated data stores, data service transactions, and data transformation and validation using an agile, agile and developer-friendly development approach. Provides federation support by combining data from multiple sources in single response or resource and also supports nested queries between data sources.  More product information WSO2 DSS at: https://docs.wso2.com/display/DSS322/Downloading+the+Product  In this experiment a CRUD was created using WSO2 DSS + MySQL Database.  In a few minutes it is possible to create the CRUD BeckEnd with the tool.  It follows step by step for the development of the experience:  Note: Verify that the Oracle 7 Java environment variables are preconfigured (JAVA_HOME).  1- Download WSO2 DSS and unpack. 2- Copy a JDBC MySql lib (mysql-connector-java-5.1.40.zip) into the "repository / components / lib" path of the WSO2 DSS tool. 2- Run the "wso2server.sh" file in the "/ bin" directory if the OS is Linux or "wso2server.bat" for Windows OS. 3- Create a Database in MySQL as Script "Script_Create_Database.sql". 4- If the tool was successfully executed, it will display something like: "[2017-04-03 11: 08: 15,957] INFO {org.wso2.carbon.ui.internal.CarbonUIServiceComponent} - Mgt Console URL: https://10.0.0.104:9443/carbon/" 5- Access this address through the Chrome browser or Firefox and enter the default user and password "admin". 6- Add the link in the security exception if the browser asks for it. 7- Access the menu path Settings> Datasources> Add Datasources. 8- Fill in the form with the data: > Datasource Type: RDBMS > Name: control_product_db > Database Engine: MySQL > Driver: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver > URL: jdbc: mysql: // localhost: 3306 / control_product_db > User Name: <bank user> > Password: <bank password> 9- Click the "Test Connection" button, if the tool shows the message "Connection is healthy", you have done everything correctly and the tool already has a connection to the DB; 10- Access the Main> Generate menu path and fill in the data: > Carbon Datasource (s): control_product_db > Database Name: control_product_db 11- Click the "Next" button. 12- Soon the tool will display the table where CRUD will be carried out, keep the "product" table marked and click "Next". In Service Generation, select the option of "Single Service", that is a service for CRUD of all the table, since we only have the table product. 13- Fill in the data with: > Data Service Namespace: ProductService > Data Service Name: ProductService 14- Click "Next" 15- The tool will return the information: "Following Service (s) are Deployed Sucessfully" ProductService. 16- Click "Finish" and after 30 seconds, access the Main> Services> List menu, where you will see ProductService created. 17- Clicking the "Try this service" option, the tool will open a new tab in the browser with a graphical interface (FrontEnd) with the options of: > Delete_product_operation > Insert_product_operation > Select_all_product_operation > Select_with_key_product_operation > Update_product_operation 18- After choosing the insert operation for example, you must complete the values ‚Äã‚Äãinside the XML tags, such as the insert option:  ====================================================================== ============ <Body>    <P: insert_product_operation xmlns: p = "ProductService">       <! - Exactly 1 occurrence ->       <P: product_name> Pen </ p: product_name>       <! - Exactly 1 occurrence ->       <P: product_price> 1.00 </ p: product_price>       <! - Exactly 1 occurrence ->       <P: product_description> BIC pen </ p: product_description>       <! - Exactly 1 occurrence ->       <P: product_amount> 1 </ p: product_amount>       <! - Exactly 1 occurrence ->       <P: product_date_created> 2017-04-03 </ p: product_date_created>       <! - Exactly 1 occurrence ->       <P: is_active> 1 </ p: is_active>       <! - Exactly 1 occurrence ->       <P: is_created> 1 </ p: is_created>    </ P: insert_product_operation> </ Body> ====================================================================== ================ 19- After filling the data in the XML interface, you must click the "Send" button to perform the operation.  20- Finish !!!

It was the first computer software training business in the area and was immediately successful. Over the decade since its inception, NLT has grown steadily and is still the market leader in computer training in the Pittsfield area. The growth of the company has caused bookkeeping problems for the company who, up until the present, have kept all their business records in a series of MS Excel spreadsheets. To address the inadequacy of the current system we were asked to prepare a database system for NLT from the ground up.  In addition, we need to answer client's specific questions and make recommendations from our findings. |

A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries.  In this project, you are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. You are going to find the answers to questions like:  What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset? Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like? What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators? The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015. |
