An extended Kalman filter is used to estimate attitude in direction cosine matrix (DCM) formation and gyroscope biases online. A variable measurement covariance method is implemented for acceleration measurements to ensure robustness against temporarily non-gravitational accelerations which usually induce errors to attitude estimate in ordinary IMU-algorithms.  The code and data will be added after related scientific work is published and open source publication is approved. |

So essentially, the concept of Reinforcement Learning Controllers has been established. The Reinforcement Learning Controllers have been compared on the basis of performance and efficiency and they are separately compared with the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator Controller. Each of the RL controller have been integrated with a Swing up controller. A virtual switch toggles between the Swing up controller and the RL controller automatically, based on the value of the angular deviation theta with respect to the vertical plane. My research paper and my undergraduate thesis have been uploaded for reference. All the codes have also been uploaded.   |

I applied the anisotropic diffusion algorithm to preprocess images, then an active contour model using a gradient vector flow was employed. In the end, the contour of a lesion area of the ultrasonic images was extracted. |
