It connects to the internet over Wi-Fi to trigger whatever action you have assigned to it using a simple, online interface. One click, one task. It‚Äôs that simple.  Unlike many other ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù devices, 1btn does not maintain a continuous connection to the internet. Instead, it sleeps until it is pressed, then it connects to the internet, performs the assigned task, tells you the outcome via its multi-colored LEDs, and then returns to rest. |

Our framework consists of a set of interfaces, accessed by a controller. Typical interfaces are 1-D tapes or 2-D grids that hold the input and output data. For the controller, we explore a range of neural network-based models which vary in their ability to abstract the underlying algorithm from training instances and generalize to test examples with many thousands of digits. The controller is trained using Q-learning with several enhancements and we show that the bottleneck is in the capabilities of the controller rather than in the search incurred by Q-learning. |
