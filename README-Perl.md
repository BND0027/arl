It executes BLAST analysis with UniProt, NCBI Conserved Domain Database and Nucleotide divisions, Gene Ontology, UniPathways and the Enzyme Commission. It gives information about the longest ORF (using DNA2PEP) and non-coding potential of the sequences (using Portrait). A final heuristic makes Annocript able to identify putative long non-coding RNAs among your transcripts. Like our facebook page to be always updated: https://www.facebook.com/annocript |
