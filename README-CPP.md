I built GGK for a personal project. That project's communication needs have grown considerably, beyond the point where Bluetooth LE is a viable option and I was forced to make the switch to an IP-based solution. As much as I've enjoyed building and using GGK, I no longer have a use-case for Bluetooh LE or a test-case for GGK. |
