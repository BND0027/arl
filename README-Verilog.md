VSDFLOW  is  completely  build  using OPHW tools, where the user gives input RTL in verilog. From here on the VSDFLOW takes control, RTL is synthesized (using Yosys). The synthesized netlist is given to PNR tool (Qflow) and finally Sign-off is done with STA tool (using Opentimer). The output of the flow is GDSII layout and performance & area metrics of your design. VSDFLOW also provide hooks at all stages for users working at different levels of design flow. It is tested for 30k instance count design like ARM Cortex-M0, and can be further tested for multi-million instance count using hierarchical or glue logic. |

Once it comes true, machines can make different responses to all kinds of human's postures. But the process is very difficult as well, because usually it is very slow and power-consuming, and requires a very large memory space. Here we focus on real-time posture recognition, and try to make the machine "know" what posture we make. The posture recognition system is consisted of DE10-Nano SoC FPGA Kit, a camera, and an HDMI monitor. SoC FPGA captures video streams from the camera, recognizes human postures with a CNN model, and finally shows the original video and classification result (standing, walking, waving, etc.) via HDMI interface. |
